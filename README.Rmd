This repository is designed to serve as a centralized collection of reusable, customizable templates for generating reports. We aim to make already public information more accessible by organizing it in consistent, easy-to-use formats. By offering transparent, open-source templates, we aim to empower anyone to generate these reports reliably and independently.
